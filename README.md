### Usage instructions

Find the .gradle folder in your home directory:

* Windows: `C:\Users\<Your Username>\.gradle`
* Mac: `/Users/<Your Username>/.gradle`
* Linux: `/home/<Your Username>/.gradle`

Inside it there would be a file named `gradle.properties` (just create it if there isn't any).

In this file you'll have to add a new registry. Like this:

`TMDB_KEY="your comic vine api"`
